# Carousel Project

This project implements a simple image carousel using JavaScript, allowing users to navigate through images with previous and next buttons or automatic scrolling.

## Features

- Manual navigation between images with "previous" and "next" buttons.
- Automatic scrolling through images every 2 seconds.
- Smooth transition effect for a better user experience.

## How It Works

- The carousel updates its position based on the index of the current image.
- Navigation is handled by event listeners on the "previous" and "next" buttons.
- The `setInterval` function enables automatic image changes every 2 seconds.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your images inside the `.carousel-item` divs in the `index.html` file.
3. Open the `index.html` in a browser to see the carousel in action.
